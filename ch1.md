Ch1. Introduction to Biostatistics
==============================

## 1.1 What is Biostatistics?  Page 1

Definition:

    Biostatistics is the area of statistics that covers and provides the specialized methodology 
    for collecting and analyzing biomedical and health care data.
    
Purpose:

    Gather data taht can be used to provide honest information about unanswered biomedical questions.
    
    
## 1.2 Popolations, Samples, and Statistics      Page 2-9

<strong>Target Population: </strong> the population that is being studied in research.

<strong>Sample: </strong> the subset of the population.

<strong>Statistics: </strong> the science of describing populations in the presence of uncertainty.

#### 1.2.1 The Basic Biostatistical Terminology    Page 3-5

target population

    the population that is being studied in research    

units
    
    the units of a target population are the objects on which the mesurements will be taken.

subpopulation

    it's a well-defined subset of the population units.

parameter

    a numerical measure of a characteristic of the target population

sample

    subset of the target population units.

sample size

    number of units observed in the sample

randam sample

    a sample that is chosen according to a sampling plan.

statistic

    any value that is computed using only the sample observations and known values.

cohort

    a group of subjects having similar characteristics.

variable

    characteristics that will be recorded or measured on a unit in the target population

response variable / outcome variable

    the variable that is being modeled.
    
explanatory variable
    
    variable that are believed to cause changes in the response variable.
    
treatment
    
    experimental condition that is applied to the units.
    
placebo
    
    inert or inactive treatment that is applied to the units.
    
statistical inference

    estimate, conclusion, or generalization made about the target population

statistical model

    relates the response variable to the explanatory variables.
